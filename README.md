# üß† ADK Playground: LegalBot

This project is a  AI legal assistant powered by Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK). It simulates how a multi-agent system can analyze legal contracts‚Äîextracting key details, summarizing content, and flagging potential legal risks‚Äîentirely in a local development environment.

## üîç What It Does

- Reads raw legal text from contract files
- Extracts parties, dates, and terms
- Summarizes legal clauses into simple language
- Detects potential issues like missing arbitration clauses or vague terms

This is not a toy example‚Äîit mimics real-world legal workflows using a modular, extensible agent-based design.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baburam1985/adk-playground-legalbot.git
cd adk-playground-legalbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Your API Keys

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"  # optional fallback
```

> üí° Want to avoid exposing keys? Use `.env` + `python-dotenv` (optional setup).
